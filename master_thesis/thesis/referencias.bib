abstract = {Many recent analysis-by-synthesis density estimation models of cortical learning and processing have made the crucial simplifying assumption that units within a single layer are mutually independent given the states of units in the layer below or the layer above. In this article, we suggest using either a Markov random field or an alternative stochastic sampling architecture to capture explicitly particular forms of dependence within each layer. We develop the architectures in the context of real and binary Helmholtz machines. Recurrent sampling can be used to capture correlations within layers in the generative or the recognition models, and we also show how these can be combined.},

@article{Zheng2018,
abstract = {VAE requires the standard Gaussian distribution as a prior in the latent space. Since all codes tend to follow the same prior, it often suffers the so-called "posterior collapse". To avoid this, this paper introduces the class specific distribution for the latent code. But different from CVAE, we present a method for disentangling the latent space into the label relevant and irrelevant dimensions, {\$}\backslashbm{\{}\backslashmathrm{\{}z{\}}{\}}{\_}s{\$} and {\$}\backslashbm{\{}\backslashmathrm{\{}z{\}}{\}}{\_}u{\$}, for a single input. We apply two separated encoders to map the input into {\$}\backslashbm{\{}\backslashmathrm{\{}z{\}}{\}}{\_}s{\$} and {\$}\backslashbm{\{}\backslashmathrm{\{}z{\}}{\}}{\_}u{\$} respectively, and then give the concatenated code to the decoder to reconstruct the input. The label irrelevant code {\$}\backslashbm{\{}\backslashmathrm{\{}z{\}}{\}}{\_}u{\$} represent the common characteristics of all inputs, hence they are constrained by the standard Gaussian, and their encoder is trained in amortized variational inference way, like VAE. While {\$}\backslashbm{\{}\backslashmathrm{\{}z{\}}{\}}{\_}s{\$} is assumed to follow the Gaussian mixture distribution in which each component corresponds to a particular class. The parameters for the Gaussian components in {\$}\backslashbm{\{}\backslashmathrm{\{}z{\}}{\}}{\_}s{\$} encoder are optimized by the label supervision in a global stochastic way. In theory, we show that our method is actually equivalent to adding a KL divergence term on the joint distribution of {\$}\backslashbm{\{}\backslashmathrm{\{}z{\}}{\}}{\_}s{\$} and the class label {\$}c{\$}, and it can directly increase the mutual information between {\$}\backslashbm{\{}\backslashmathrm{\{}z{\}}{\}}{\_}s{\$} and the label {\$}c{\$}. Our model can also be extended to GAN by adding a discriminator in the pixel domain so that it produces high quality and diverse images.},

abstract = {We propose a greedy mixture reduction algorithm which is capable of pruning mixture components as well as merging them based on the Kullback-Leibler divergence (KLD). The algorithm is distinct from the well-known Runnalls' KLD based method since it is not restricted to merging operations. The capability of pruning (in addition to merging) gives the algorithm the ability of preserving the peaks of the original mixture during the reduction. Analytical approximations are derived to circumvent the computational intractability of the KLD which results in a computationally efficient method. The proposed algorithm is compared with Runnalls' and Williams' methods in two numerical examples, using both simulated and real world data. The results indicate that the performance and computational complexity of the proposed approach make it an efficient alternative to existing mixture reduction methods.},

However, both this and other reinforcement learning transfer methods have little theoretical analysis. This paper formally defines a setting where multiple teacher agents can provide advice to a student and introduces an algorithm to leverage both autonomous exploration and teacher's advice. Our regret bounds justify the intuition that good teachers help while bad teachers hurt. Using our formalization, we are also able to quantify, for the first time, when negative transfer can occur within such a reinforcement learning setting.},

This paper proposes a deep reinforcement learning algorithm to recognize the human arm movement patterns using an IoT sensor device. Recent studies have explored supervised learning based methods, such as CNN and RNN to implement the HCl device. On the other hand, the deep reinforcement learning approach has also been investigated. Algorithms using this approach, learn the patterns from sensors using only the reward feedback with no class labels. This allows users to control the IoT device and produce the desired arm movement patterns without creating any labels. In this paper, the performance of convolutional neural network (CNN) with the DQN model was compared with that of long short-term memory (LSTM) models with DQN. Results show that the CNN based DQN model was more stable compared to the LSTM based model, and yielded a high classification accuracy of 98.33{\%} to predict the arm movement patterns.},

abstract = {Variational autoencoders (VAE) represent a popular, flexible form of deep generative model that can be stochastically fit to samples from a given random process using an information-theoretic variational bound on the true underlying distribution. Once so-obtained, the model can be putatively used to generate new samples from this distribution, or to provide a low-dimensional latent representation of existing samples. While quite effective in numerous application domains, certain important mechanisms which govern the behavior of the VAE are obfuscated by the intractable integrals and resulting stochastic approximations involved. Moreover, as a highly non-convex model, it remains unclear exactly how minima of the underlying energy relate to original design purposes. We attempt to better quantify these issues by analyzing a series of tractable special cases of increasing complexity. In doing so, we unveil interesting connections with more traditional dimensionality reduction models, as well as an intrinsic yet underappreciated propensity for robustly dismissing sparse outliers when estimating latent manifolds. With respect to the latter, we demonstrate that the VAE can be viewed as the natural evolution of recent robust PCA models, capable of learning nonlinear manifolds of unknown dimension obscured by gross corruptions.},

Here we introduce a new approach to computer Go that uses ‘value networks' to evaluate board positions and ‘policy networks' to select moves. These deep neural networks are trained by a novel combination of supervised learning from human expert games, and reinforcement learning from games of self-play. Without any lookahead search, the neural networks play Go at the level of state-of-the-art Monte Carlo tree search programs that simulate thousands of random games of self-play. We also introduce a new search algorithm that combines Monte Carlo simulation with value and policy networks. Using this search algorithm, our program AlphaGo achieved a 99.8{\%} winning rate against other Go programs, and defeated the human European Go champion by 5 games to 0. This is the first time that a computer program has defeated a human professional player in the full-sized game of Go, a feat previously thought to be at least a decade away.},

Based on recent deep learning works such as style transfer, we employ a pre-trained deep convolutional neural network (CNN) and use its hidden features to define a feature perceptual loss for VAE training. Evaluated on the CelebA face dataset, we show that our model produces better results than other methods in the literature.

abstract = {Policy gradient methods are an appealing approach in reinforcement learning because they directly optimize the cumulative reward and can straightforwardly be used with nonlinear function approximators such as neural networks. The two main challenges are the large number of samples typically required, and the difficulty of obtaining stable and steady improvement despite the nonstationarity of the incoming data. We address the first challenge by using value functions to substantially reduce the variance of policy gradient estimates at the cost of some bias, with an exponentially-weighted estimator of the advantage function that is analogous to TD(lambda). We address the second challenge by using trust region optimization procedure for both the policy and the value function, which are represented by neural networks. Our approach yields strong empirical results on highly challenging 3D locomotion tasks, learning running gaits for bipedal and quadrupedal simulated robots, and learning a policy for getting the biped to stand up from starting out lying on the ground. In contrast to a body of prior work that uses hand-crafted policy representations, our neural network policies map directly from raw kinematics to joint torques. Our algorithm is fully model-free, and the amount of simulated experience required for the learning tasks on 3D bipeds corresponds to 1-2 weeks of real time.},

abstract = {We present a novel method for constructing Variational Autoencoder (VAE). Instead of using pixel-by-pixel loss, we enforce deep feature consistency between the input and the output of a VAE, which ensures the VAE's output to preserve the spatial correlation characteristics of the input, thus leading the output to have a more natural visual appearance and better perceptual quality. Based on recent deep learning works such as style transfer, we employ a pre-trained deep convolutional neural network (CNN) and use its hidden features to define a feature perceptual loss for VAE training. Evaluated on the CelebA face dataset, we show that our model produces better results than other methods in the literature. We also show that our method can produce latent vectors that can capture the semantic information of face expressions and can be used to achieve state-of-the-art performance in facial attribute prediction.},

abstract = {Variational autoencoders (VAE) represent a popular, flexible form of deep generative model that can be stochastically fit to samples from a given random process using an information-theoretic variational bound on the true underlying distribution. Once so-obtained, the model can be putatively used to generate new samples from this distribution, or to provide a low-dimensional latent representation of existing samples. While quite effective in numerous application domains, certain important mechanisms which govern the behavior of the VAE are obfuscated by the intractable integrals and resulting stochastic approximations involved. Moreover, as a highly non-convex model, it remains unclear exactly how minima of the underlying energy relate to original design purposes. We attempt to better quantify these issues by analyzing a series of tractable special cases of increasing complexity. In doing so, we unveil interesting connections with more traditional dimensionality reduction models, as well as an intrinsic yet underappreciated propensity for robustly dismissing sparse outliers when estimating latent manifolds. With respect to the latter, we demonstrate that the VAE can be viewed as the natural evolution of recent robust PCA models, capable of learning nonlinear manifolds of unknown dimension obscured by gross corruptions.},

Specifically, therapy can be provided within a functional, purposeful and motivating context. Many VR applications present opportunities for individuals to participate in experiences, which are engaging and rewarding. In addition to the value of the rehabilitation experience for the user, both therapists and users benefit from the ability to readily grade and document the therapeutic intervention using various systems. In VR, advanced technologies are used to produce simulated, interactive and multi-dimensional environments. Visual interfaces including desktop monitors and head-mounted displays (HMDs), haptic interfaces, and real-time motion tracking devices are used to create environments allowing users to interact with images and virtual objects in real-time through multiple sensory modalities. Opportunities for object manipulation and body movement through virtual space provide frameworks that, in varying degrees, are perceived as comparable to similar opportunities in the real world. This paper reviews current work on motor rehabilitation using virtual environments and virtual reality and where possible, compares outcomes with those achieved in real-world applications.},

abstract = {Human motor control relies on a combination of feedback and feedforward strategies. The aim of this study was to longitudinally investigate artificial somatosensory feedback and feedforward control in the context of grasping with myoelectric prosthesis. Nine amputee subjects performed routine grasping trials, with the aim to produce four levels of force during four blocks of 60 trials across five days. The electrotactile force feedback was provided in the second and third block using multipad electrode and spatial coding. The first baseline and last validation block (open-loop control) evaluated the effects of long- (across sessions) and short-term (within session) learning, respectively. The outcome measures were the absolute error between the generated and target force, and the number of force saturations. The results demonstrated that the electrotactile feedback improved the performance both within and across sessions. In the validation block, the performance did not significantly decrease and the quality of open-loop control (baseline) improved across days, converging to the performance characterizing closed-loop control. This paper provides important insights into the feedback and feedforward processes in prosthesis control, contributing to the better understanding of the role and design of feedback in prosthetic systems.},

abstract = {The surface electromyography (sEMG) technique is proposed for muscle activation detection and intuitive control of prostheses or robot arms. Motion recognition is widely used to map sEMG signals to the target motions. One of the main factors preventing the implementation of this kind of method for real-time applications is the unsatisfactory motion recognition rate and time consumption. The purpose of this paper is to compare eight combinations of four feature extraction methods (Root Mean Square (RMS), Detrended Fluctuation Analysis (DFA), Weight Peaks (WP), and Muscular Model (MM)) and two classifiers (Neural Networks (NN) and Support Vector Machine (SVM)), for the task of mapping sEMG signals to eight upper-limb motions, to find out the relation between these methods and propose a proper combination to solve this issue. Seven subjects participated in the experiment and six muscles of the upper-limb were selected to record sEMG signals. The experimental results showed that NN classifier obtained the highest recognition accuracy rate (88.7{\%}) during the training process while SVM performed better in real-time experiments (85.9{\%}). For time consumption, SVM took less time than NN during the training process but needed more time for real-time computation. Among the four feature extraction methods, WP had the highest recognition rate for the training process (97.7{\%}) while MM performed the best during real-time tests (94.3{\%}). The combination of MM and NN is recommended for strict real-time applications while a combination of MM and SVM will be more suitable when time consumption is not a  key requirement.},

However, the current dominant machine learning paradigm learns in isolation: given a training dataset, it runs a machine learning algorithm on the dataset to produce a model.

abstract = {Knowledge transfer between tasks can improve the performance of learned models, but requires an accurate estimate of the inter-task relationships to identify the relevant knowledge to transfer. These inter-task relationships are typically estimated based on training data for each task, which is inefficient in lifelong learning settings where the goal is to learn each consecutive task rapidly from as little data as possible. To reduce this burden, we develop a lifelong learning method based on coupled dictionary learning that utilizes high-level task descriptions to model the inter-task relationships. We show that using task descriptors improves the performance of the learned task policies, providing both theoretical justification for the benefit and empirical demonstration of the improvement across a variety of learning problems. Given only the descriptor for a new task, the lifelong learner is also able to accurately predict a model for the new task through zero-shot learning using the coupled dictionary, eliminating the need to gather training data before addressing the task.},

abstract = {In classic supervised learning, a learning algorithm takes a fixed training data of several classes to build a classifier. In this paper, we propose to study a new problem, i.e., building a learning system that learns cumulatively. As time goes by, the system sees and learns more and more classes of data and becomes more and more knowledgeable. We believe that this is similar to human learning. We humans learn continuously, retaining the learned knowledge, identifying and learning new things, and updating the existing knowledge with new experiences. Over time, we cumulate more and more knowledge. A learning system should be able to do the same. As algorithmic learning matures, it is time to tackle this cumulative machine learning (or simply cumulative learning) problem, which is a kind of lifelong machine learning problem. It presents two major challenges. First, the system must be able to detect data from unseen classes in the test set. Classic supervised learning, however, assumes all classes in testing are known or seen at the training time. Second, the system needs to be able to selectively update its models whenever a new class of data arrives without re-training the whole system using the entire past and present training data. This paper proposes a novel approach and system to tackle these challenges. Experimental results on two datasets with learning from 2 classes to up to 100 classes show that the proposed approach is highly promising in terms of both classification accuracy and computational efficiency.},

abstract = {Machine learning (ML) has been instrumental for the ad-vances of both data analysis and artificial intelligence (AI). The recent success of deep learning brings it to a new height. ML algorithms have been successfully used in almost all ar-eas of applications in industry, science, and engineering. The current dominant paradigm for ML is to run an ML al-gorithm on a given dataset to generate a model. The model is then applied in real-life tasks. We call this paradigm isolated learning because it does not consider any other related infor-mation or the knowledge learned in the past. The fundamental problem with this isolated learning is that it has no memory. It does not retain knowledge learned in the past and use it to help future learning. As a result, a large number of train-ing examples are needed to learn effectively. For supervised learning, training data labeling is often done manually, which is very labor-intensive and time-consuming. Since the world simply has too many possible tasks, it is almost impossible to label a large number of examples for each task in order for an ML algorithm to learn. To make matters worse, every-thing also changes constantly, and the labeling thus needs to be done continuously, which is a daunting task. The current isolated learning paradigm is probably not suitable for build-ing a truly intelligent system, but only suitable for solving problems in very narrow domains. We human beings seem to learn quite differently. We never learn in isolation. Instead, we always retain and accumulate the knowledge learned in the past and use it seamlessly in future learning. Over time we learn more and more and be-come more and more knowledgeable, and more and more effective at learning.

abstract = {-We propose a lifelong learning method for Support Vector Machine (SVM) training called L 3 -SVM. It focuses on the large-scale and endless stream data which are usually the characteristics of lifelong learning. The batch SVM cannot han­ dle large-scale data for the huge space and time requirements and also cannot learn incrementally. In order to solve these two problems, we introduce a Prototype Support Layer (PSL) before SVM training, which is maintained by a Learning Prototype Network (LPN). The LPN learns representative prototypes from the input data in an online way and the PSL records the learned prototypes based on which the SVM is trained. As the size of the prototypes in the PSL is small in comparison with original data, L 3 -SVM is very fast. Another challenge of lifelong learning is the "open-ended" environment, i.e. data from novel classes or new distributions may occur during learning, upon which the classifiers should be retrained or updated. Many versions of incremental SVM only retain the Support Vectors after training, losing much potentially useful information of the original data, which leads to a declined performance as new data arrives. The PSL, on the other hand, works as a Long Te rm Memory (LTM) system. It records the representative prototypes of all previous data. Experiments demonstrate that the SVM trained upon these representative prototypes is as accurate as the state-of-the­ art SVM, and much faster and can handle much larger data set than existing methods. Moreover, due to the incremental and self-adaptive properties of LPN, L 3 -SVM is able to work efficiently and effectively when novel class data come.},

We validate DEN on multiple public datasets under lifelong learning scenarios, on which it not only significantly outperforms existing lifelong learning methods for deep networks, but also achieves the same level of performance as the batch counterparts with substantially fewer number of parameters. Further, the obtained network fine-tuned on all tasks obtained significantly better performance over the batch models, which shows that it can be used to estimate the optimal network structure even when all tasks are available in the first place.},

abstract = {This study proposes a real-time electro-myogram (EMG) pattern recognition approach for the control of multifunction myoelectric hands. In techniques, time and frequency information is extracted by wavelet packet transform (WPT) and the node energy of the WPT coefficients is selected as the feature of the EMG signals. Then a novel feature selection method based on a depth recursive search algorithm is developed so that the high-dimensional features can be reduced by a supervised feature reduction algorithm. Consequently, the support vector machine (SVM) is adopted to give the recognition result. In the experiment, a real-time EMG pattern recognition system is developed to control a virtual hand with EMG signals from antebrachium. The experimental results show both the high accuracy and better real-time performance of the proposed method. {\textcopyright} 2014 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {In this paper, we present a systematic analysis of the relationship between the accuracy of the mapping between EMG and hand kinematics and the control performance in goal-oriented tasks of three simultaneous and proportional myoelectric control algorithms: nonnegative matrix factorization (NMF), linear regression (LR), and artificial neural networks (ANN). The purpose was to investigate the impact of the precision of the kinematics estimation by a myoelectric controller for accurately complete goal-directed tasks. Nine na{\"{i}}ve subjects performed a series of goal-directed myoelectric control tasks using the three algorithms, and their online performance was characterized by 6 indexes. The results showed that, although the three algorithms' mapping accuracies were significantly different, their online performance was similar. Moreover, for LR and ANN, the offline performance was not correlated to any of the online performance indexes, and only a weak correlation was found with three of them for NMF . We conclude that for reliable simultaneous and proportional myoelectric control, it is not necessary to achieve high accuracy in the mapping between EMG and kinematics. Rather, good online myoelectric control is achieved by the continuous interaction and adaptation of the user with the myoelectric controller through feedback (visual in the current study). Control signals generated by EMG with rather poor association with kinematic variables can still be fully exploited by the user for precise control. This conclusion explains the possibility of accurate simultaneous and proportional control over multiple degrees of freedom when using unsupervised algorithms, such as NMF.},

abstract = {In pattern recognition-based myoelectric control, high accuracy for multiple discriminated motions is presented in most of related literature. However, there is a gap between the classification accuracy and the usability of practical applications of myoelectric control, especially the effect of long-term usage. This paper proposes and investigates the behavior of fifty time-domain and frequency-domain features to classify ten upper limb motions using electromyographic data recorded during 21 days. The most stable single feature and multiple feature sets are presented with the optimum configuration of myoe lectric control, i.e. data segmentation and classifier. The result shows that sample entropy (SampEn) outper- forms other features when compared using linear discriminant analysis (LDA), a robust classifier. The averaged test classification accuracy is 93.37{\%}, when trained in only initial first day. It brings only 2.45{\%} decrease compared with retraining schemes. Increasing number of features to four, which consists of SampEn, the fourth order cepstrum coefficients, root mean square and waveform length, increase the classification accuracy to 98.87{\%}. The proposed techniques achieve to maintain the high accuracy without the retraining scheme. Additionally, this continuous classification allows the real-time operation. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Time-domain features have been shown to have good performance in upper limb movement classification. However, the performance of EMG-PR prostheses driven by the existing time-domain features is still unsatisfactory. Hence, this study proposed three new time-domain features to improve the performance of EMG-PR based strategy in arm movement classification. EMG signals were recorded from the residual arms of eight amputees while performing different upper limb movements. Then, the newly proposed features were extracted and used to classify their limb movements. Experimental results showed that the proposed features could achieved an average classification accuracy of 92.00{\%} ± 3.11{\%} which was 6.49{\%} higher than that of the commonly used time-domain features (p {\textless} 0.05). With three additional metrics, the proposed features also performed better, which suggest that the new features may be potential for improving the clinical performance of EMG-PR prostheses.},

In this study, different metrics relating the fundamental binary prediction outcomes were analyzed. Our results indicate that global accuracy is biased by 1) the unbalanced number of possible true positive and negative outcomes, and 2) the almost perfect specificity and negative predicted value, which were consistently found across algorithms, topologies, and movements (individual and simultaneous). Therefore, class-specific accuracy is advisable instead. Additionally, we propose the use of precision (positive predictive value) and sensitivity (recall) as a complement to accuracy to better describe the discrimination capabilities of MPR algorithms, as these consider the effect of false predictions. However, all the studied offline metrics failed to predict real-time decoding, and therefore real-time testing continue to be necessary to truly evaluate the clinical usability of MPR.},

The scheme described within uses pattern recognition to process four channels of MES, with the task of discriminating multiple classes of limb movement. The method does not require segmentation of the MES data, allowing a continuous stream of class decisions to be delivered to a prosthetic device. It is shown in this paper that, by exploiting the processing power inherent in current computing systems, substantial gains in classifier accuracy and response time are possible. Other important characteristics for prosthetic control systems are met as well. Due to the fact that the classifier learns the muscle activation patterns for each desired class for each individual, a natural control actuation results. The continuous decision stream allows complex sequences of manipulation involving multiple joints to be performed without interruption. Finally, minimal storage capacity is required, which is an important factor in embedded control systems.},

The adaptation procedure was firstly introduced, and then the proposed ALDA classifier was trained and tested with surface EMG recordings related to multiple motion patterns. The accuracies of the ALDA classifier and traditional LDA classifier were compared when the EMG recordings were added with different degrees of noise.

abstract = {Pattern recognition methods for classifying user motion intent based on surface electromyography developed by research groups in well-controlled laboratory conditions are not yet clinically viable for upper limb prosthesis control, due to their limited robustness in users' real-life situations. To address this problem, a novel postprocessing algorithm, aiming to detect and remove misclassifications of a pattern recognition system of forearm and hand motions, is proposed. Using the maximum likelihood calculated by a classifier and the mean global muscle activity of the forearm, an artificial neural network was trained to detect potentially erroneous classification decisions. This system was compared to four previously proposed classification postprocessing methods, in both able-bodied and amputee subjects. Various nonstationarities were included in the experimental protocol to account for challenges posed in real-life settings, such as different contraction levels, static and dynamic motion phases, and effects induced by day-to-day transfers, such as electrode shifts, impedance changes, and psychometric user variability. The improvement in classification accuracy with respect to the unprocessed classifier ranged from 4.8{\%} to 31.6{\%}, depending on the scenarios investigated. The system significantly reduced misclassifications to wrong active classes and is thus a promising approach for improving the robustness of hand prosthesis controllability.},

abstract = {Surface electromyography (sEMG) is a technique for recording natural muscle activation signals, which can serve as control inputs for exoskeletons and prosthetic devices. Previous experiments have incorporated these signals using both classical and pattern-recognition control methods in order to actuate such devices. We used the results of an experiment incorporating grasp and release actions with object contact to develop an intent-recognition system based on Gaussian mixture models (GMM) and continuous-emission hidden Markov models (HMM) of sEMG data. We tested this system with data collected from 16 individuals using a forearm band with distributed sEMG sensors. The data contain trials with shifted band alignments to assess robustness to sensor placement. This study evaluated and found that pattern-recognition-based methods could classify transient anticipatory sEMG signals in the presence of shifted sensor placement and object contact. With the best-performing classifier, the effect of label lengths in the training data was also examined. A mean classification accuracy of 75.96{\%} was achieved through a unigram HMM method with five mixture components. Classification accuracy on different sub-movements was found to be limited by the length of the shortest sub-movement, which means that shorter sub-movements within dynamic sequences require larger training sets to be classified correctly. This classification of user intent is a potential control mechanism for a dynamic grasping task involving user contact with external objects and noise. Further work is required to test its performance as part of an exoskeleton controller, which involves contact with actuated external surfaces.},

abstract = {At the time of this writing, the main means of control for polyarticulated self-powered hand prostheses is surface electromyography (sEMG). In the clinical setting, data collected from two electrodes are used to guide the hand movements selecting among a finite number of postures. Machine learning has been applied in the past to the sEMG signal (not in the clinical setting) with interesting results, which provide more insight on how these data could be used to improve prosthetic functionality. Researchers have mainly concentrated so far on increasing the accuracy of sEMG classification and/or regression, but, in general, a finer control implies a longer training period. A desirable characteristic would be to shorten the time needed by a patient to learn how to use the prosthesis. To this aim, we propose here a general method to reuse past experience, in the form of models synthesized from previous subjects, to boost the adaptivity of the prosthesis. Extensive tests on databases recorded from healthy subjects in controlled and noncontrolled conditions reveal that the method significantly improves the results over the baseline nonadaptive case. This promising approach might be employed to pretrain a prosthesis before shipping it to a patient, leading to a shorter training phase.},

The criterion extends the optimization criteria of the classical Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) through the use of the pseudoinverse when the scatter matrices are singular. It is applicable regardless of the relative sizes of the data dimension and sample size, overcoming a limitation of classical LDA. The optimization problem can be solved analytically by applying the Generalized Singular Value Decomposition (GSVD) technique. The pseudoinverse has been suggested and used for undersampled problems in the past, where the data dimension exceeds the number of data points. The criterion proposed in this paper provides a theoretical justification for this procedure. An approximation algorithm for the GSVD-based approach is also presented. It reduces the computational complexity by finding subclusters of each cluster and uses their centroids to capture the structure of each cluster. This reduced problem yields much smaller matrices to which the GSVD can be applied efficiently. Experiments on text data, with up to 7,000 dimensions, show that the approximation algorithm produces results that are close to those produced by the exact algorithm.},

Alternatively, researchers could focus on prosthesis acceptance by developing functional requirements based on activities users are likely to perform. In this article, we describe the process of determining such requirements and then the application of these requirements to evaluating the state of the art in myoelectric forearm prosthesis research. As part of a needs assessment, a workshop was organized involving clinicians (representing end users), academics, and engineers. The resulting needs included an increased number of functions, lower reaction and execution times, and intuitiveness of both control and feedback systems. Reviewing the state of the art of research in the main prosthetic subsystems (electromyographic [EMG] sensing, control, and feedback) showed that modern research prototypes only partly fulfill the requirements. We found that focus should be on validating EMG-sensing results with patients, improving simultaneous control of wrist movements and grasps, deriving optimal parameters for force and position feedback, and taking into account the psychophysical aspects of feedback, such as intensity perception and spatial acuity.},

abstract = {This study presents a novel adaptive myoelectric decoding algorithm for control of upper limb prosthesis. Myoelectric decoding algorithms are inherently subject to decay in decoding accuracy over time, which is caused by the changes occurring in the muscle signals. The proposed algorithm relies on an unsupervised and on demand update of the training set, and has been designed to adapt to both the slow and fast changes that occur in myoelectric signals. An update in the training data is used to counter the slow changes, whereas an update with label correction addresses the fast changes in the signals. We collected myoelectric data from an able bodied user for over four and a half hours, while the user performed repetitions of eight wrist movements. The major benefit of the proposed algorithm is the lower rate of decay in accuracy; it has a decay rate of 0.2 per hour as opposed to 3.3 for the non adaptive classifier. The results show that, long term decoding accuracy in EMG signals can be maintained over time, improving the performance and reliability of myoelectric prosthesis.},

abstract = {This paper represents an ongoing investigation of dexterous and natural control of upper extremity prostheses using the myoelectric signal (MES). The scheme described within uses pattern recognition to process four channels of MES, with the task of discriminating multiple classes of limb movement. The method does not require segmentation of the MES data, allowing a continuous stream of class decisions to be delivered to a prosthetic device. It is shown in this paper that, by exploiting the processing power inherent in current computing systems, substantial gains in classifier accuracy and response time are possible. Other important characteristics for prosthetic control systems are met as well. Due to the fact that the classifier learns the muscle activation patterns for each desired class for each individual, a natural control actuation results. The continuous decision stream allows complex sequences of manipulation involving multiple joints to be performed without interruption. Finally, minimal storage capacity is required, which is an important factor in embedded control systems.},

abstract = {Surface electromyography (sEMG) is a technique for recording natural muscle activation signals, which can serve as control inputs for exoskeletons and prosthetic devices. Previous experiments have incorporated these signals using both classical and pattern-recognition control methods in order to actuate such devices. We used the results of an experiment incorporating grasp and release actions with object contact to develop an intent-recognition system based on Gaussian mixture models (GMM) and continuous-emission hidden Markov models (HMM) of sEMG data. We tested this system with data collected from 16 individuals using a forearm band with distributed sEMG sensors. The data contain trials with shifted band alignments to assess robustness to sensor placement. This study evaluated and found that pattern-recognition-based methods could classify transient anticipatory sEMG signals in the presence of shifted sensor placement and object contact. With the best-performing classifier, the effect of label lengths in the training data was also examined. A mean classification accuracy of 75.96{\%} was achieved through a unigram HMM method with five mixture components. Classification accuracy on different sub-movements was found to be limited by the length of the shortest sub-movement, which means that shorter sub-movements within dynamic sequences require larger training sets to be classified correctly. This classification of user intent is a potential control mechanism for a dynamic grasping task involving user contact with external objects and noise. Further work is required to test its performance as part of an exoskeleton controller, which involves contact with actuated external surfaces.},

Subjects attended eight one-on-one training sessions that focused on improving the consistency and distinguishability of their hand and wrist movements using visual biofeedback from a virtual prosthesis. The virtual environment facilitated the precise quantification of three prosthesis control measures. During a final evaluation, the subject population saw an average increase in movement completion percentage from 70.8{\%} to 99.0{\%}, an average improvement in normalized movement completion time from 1.47 to 1.13, and an average increase in movement classifier accuracy from 77.5{\%} to 94.4{\%} (p{\textless}0.001). Additionally, all four subjects were reevaluated after eight elapsed hours without retraining the classifier, and all subjects demonstrated minimal decreases in performance. Our analysis of the underlying sources of improvement for each subject examined the sizes and separation of high-dimensional data clusters and revealed that each subject formed a unique and effective strategy for improving the consistency and/or distinguishability of his or her phantom limb movements.

abstract = {Objective. Recent studies have reported that the classification performance of electromyographic (EMG) signals degrades over time without proper classification retraining. This problem is relevant for the applications of EMG pattern recognition in the control of active prostheses. Approach. In this study we investigated the changes in EMG classification performance over 11 consecutive days in eight able-bodied subjects and two amputees. Main results. It was observed that, when the classifier was trained on data from one day and tested on data from the following day, the classification error decreased exponentially but plateaued after four days for able-bodied subjects and six to nine days for amputees. The between-day performance became gradually closer to the corresponding within-day performance. Significance. These results indicate that the relative changes in EMG signal features over time become progressively smaller when the number of days during which the subjects perform the pre-defined motions are increased. The performance of the motor tasks is thus more consistent over time, resulting in more repeatable EMG patterns, even if the subjects do not have any external feedback on their performance. The learning curves for both able-bodied subjects and subjects with limb deficiencies could be modeled as an exponential function. These results provide important insights into the user adaptation characteristics during practical long-term myoelectric control applications, with implications for the design of an adaptive pattern recognition system.},

Experimental results show that both ILDA and WILDA are very effective to improve the recognition accuracy for writer adaptation, and WILDA outperforms ILDA. The proposed WILDA based writer adaptation method can reduce as much as 47.88{\%} error rate on the writer-dependent dataset while it only has as less as 0.85{\%} accuracy loss on the writer-independent dataset. It indicates that writer adaption using WILDA can significantly increase the recognition accuracy for the particular writer while having limited impact on the accuracy for general writers. ?? 2010 Elsevier B.V.},

Basically, we propose an incremental linear discriminant analysis (ILDA) in its two forms: a sequential ILDA and a Chunk ILDA. In experiments, we have tested ILDA using datasets with a small number of classes and small-dimensional features, as well as datasets with a large number of classes and large-dimensional features. We have compared the proposed ILDA against the traditional batch LDA in terms of discriminability, execution time and memory usage with the increasing volume of data addition. The results show that the proposed ILDA can effectively evolve a discriminant eigenspace over a fast and large data stream, and extract features with superior discriminability in classification, when compared with other methods.},

abstract = {This study presents a novel adaptive myoelectric decoding algorithm for control of upper limb prosthesis. Myoelectric decoding algorithms are inherently subject to decay in decoding accuracy over time, which is caused by the changes occurring in the muscle signals. The proposed algorithm relies on an unsupervised and on demand update of the training set, and has been designed to adapt to both the slow and fast changes that occur in myoelectric signals. An update in the training data is used to counter the slow changes, whereas an update with label correction addresses the fast changes in the signals. We collected myoelectric data from an able bodied user for over four and a half hours, while the user performed repetitions of eight wrist movements. The major benefit of the proposed algorithm is the lower rate of decay in accuracy; it has a decay rate of 0.2 per hour as opposed to 3.3 for the non adaptive classifier. The results show that, long term decoding accuracy in EMG signals can be maintained over time, improving the performance and reliability of myoelectric prosthesis.},

abstract = {In this study, we propose an interface to intuitively control robotic devices by using myoelectric signals detected from human users. In particular, we show experiments in which myoelectric signals measured from a forearm are used to control a robotic hand. When a user performs different motions (e.g., grasping and pinching), different myoelectric signals are measured. On the other hand, when different users perform the same motion (e.g, grasping), also, different myoelectric signals are measured. Therefore, designing a myoelectric interface that can be used for different users to perform different motions is difficult. In this study, we propose a bilinear model to explain myoelectric signals that depend on users and motions. The bilinear model is composed of two linear factors: 1) the user- dependent factor and 2) the motion-dependent factor. Since the motion-dependent factor can be interpreted as a common representation of motion among multiple users, it allows to construct a myoelectric interface that is commonly applicable to multiple users to robotic devices.We present a learning procedure for the model using a set of myoelectric signals captured from multiple subjects, and present an adaptation procedure that adapts the model to a new user through only a few interactions. We call the combination of the model and the adaptation proce- dure the Stylistic Myoelectric Interface. Through experiments, the interface was applied to EMG-based robotic hand control and its effectiveness for multiple users was demonstrated.},

abstract = {Dimensionality reduction methods have been successfully employed for face recognition. Among the various dimensionality reduction algorithms, linear (Fisher) discriminant analysis (LDA) is one of the popular supervised dimensionality reduction methods, and many LDA-based face recognition algorithms/systems have been reported in the last decade. However, the LDA-based face recognition systems suffer from the scalability problem. To overcome this limitation, an incremental approach is a natural solution. The main difficulty in developing the incremental LDA (ILDA) is to handle the inverse of the within-class scatter matrix. In this paper, based on the generalized singular value decomposition LDA (LDA/GSVD), we develop a new ILDA algorithm called GSVD-ILDA. Different from the existing techniques in which the new projection matrix is found in a restricted subspace, the proposed GSVD-ILDA determines the projection matrix in full space. Extensive experiments are performed to compare the proposed GSVD-ILDA with the LDA/GSVD as well as the existing ILDA methods using the face recognition technology face database and the Carneggie Mellon University Pose, Illumination, and Expression face database. Experimental results show that the proposed GSVD-ILDA algorithm gives the same performance as the LDA/GSVD with much smaller computational complexity. The experimental results also show that the proposed GSVD-ILDA gives better classification performance than the other recently proposed ILDA algorithms.},

The heuristic for choosing this subset is simple to compute, and makes no use of information about the test set.

abstract = {An optimization criterion is presented for discriminant analysis. The criterion extends the optimization criteria of the classical Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) through the use of the pseudoinverse when the scatter matrices are singular. It is applicable regardless of the relative sizes of the data dimension and sample size, overcoming a limitation of classical LDA. The optimization problem can be solved analytically by applying the Generalized Singular Value Decomposition (GSVD) technique. The pseudoinverse has been suggested and used for undersampled problems in the past, where the data dimension exceeds the number of data points. The criterion proposed in this paper provides a theoretical justification for this procedure. An approximation algorithm for the GSVD-based approach is also presented. It reduces the computational complexity by finding subclusters of each cluster and uses their centroids to capture the structure of each cluster. This reduced problem yields much smaller matrices to which the GSVD can be applied efficiently. Experiments on text data, with up to 7,000 dimensions, show that the approximation algorithm produces results that are close to those produced by the exact algorithm.},

abstract = {At the time of this writing, the main means of control for polyarticulated self-powered hand prostheses is surface electromyography (sEMG). In the clinical setting, data collected from two electrodes are used to guide the hand movements selecting among a finite number of postures. Machine learning has been applied in the past to the sEMG signal (not in the clinical setting) with interesting results, which provide more insight on how these data could be used to improve prosthetic functionality. Researchers have mainly concentrated so far on increasing the accuracy of sEMG classification and/or regression, but, in general, a finer control implies a longer training period. A desirable characteristic would be to shorten the time needed by a patient to learn how to use the prosthesis. To this aim, we propose here a general method to reuse past experience, in the form of models synthesized from previous subjects, to boost the adaptivity of the prosthesis. Extensive tests on databases recorded from healthy subjects in controlled and noncontrolled conditions reveal that the method significantly improves the results over the baseline nonadaptive case. This promising approach might be employed to pretrain a prosthesis before shipping it to a patient, leading to a shorter training phase.},

abstract = {Pattern recognition is a useful tool for deciphering movement intent from myoelectric signals. Recognition paradigms must adapt with the user in order to be clinically viable over time. Most existing paradigms are static, although two forms of adaptation have received limited attention. Supervised adaptation can achieve high accuracy since the intended class is known, but at the cost of repeated cumbersome training sessions. Unsupervised adaptation attempts to achieve high accuracy without knowledge of the intended class, thus achieving adaptation that is not cumbersome to the user, but at the cost of reduced accuracy. This study reports a novel adaptive experiment on eight subjects that allowed repeated measures post-hoc comparison of four supervised and three unsupervised adaptation paradigms. All supervised adaptation paradigms reduced error over time by at least 26{\%} compared to the nonadapting classifier. Most unsupervised adaptation paradigms provided smaller reductions in error, due to frequent uncertainty of the correct class. One method that selected high-confidence samples showed the most practical implementation, although the other methods warrant future investigation. Supervised adaptation should be considered for incorporation into any clinically viable pattern recognition controller, and unsupervised adaptation should receive renewed interest in order to provide transparent adaptation.},

abstract = {User acceptance of myoelectric forearm prostheses is currently low. Awkward control, lack of feedback, and difficult training are cited as primary reasons. Recently, researchers have focused on exploiting the new possibilities offered by advancements in prosthetic technology. Alternatively, researchers could focus on prosthesis acceptance by developing functional requirements based on activities users are likely to perform. In this article, we describe the process of determining such requirements and then the application of these requirements to evaluating the state of the art in myoelectric forearm prosthesis research. As part of a needs assessment, a workshop was organized involving clinicians (representing end users), academics, and engineers. The resulting needs included an increased number of functions, lower reaction and execution times, and intuitiveness of both control and feedback systems. Reviewing the state of the art of research in the main prosthetic subsystems (electromyographic [EMG] sensing, control, and feedback) showed that modern research prototypes only partly fulfill the requirements. We found that focus should be on validating EMG-sensing results with patients, improving simultaneous control of wrist movements and grasps, deriving optimal parameters for force and position feedback, and taking into account the psychophysical aspects of feedback, such as intensity perception and spatial acuity.},

abstract = {Pattern recognition methods for classifying user motion intent based on surface electromyography developed by research groups in well-controlled laboratory conditions are not yet clinically viable for upper limb prosthesis control, due to their limited robustness in users' real-life situations. To address this problem, a novel postprocessing algorithm, aiming to detect and remove misclassifications of a pattern recognition system of forearm and hand motions, is proposed. Using the maximum likelihood calculated by a classifier and the mean global muscle activity of the forearm, an artificial neural network was trained to detect potentially erroneous classification decisions. This system was compared to four previously proposed classification postprocessing methods, in both able-bodied and amputee subjects. Various nonstationarities were included in the experimental protocol to account for challenges posed in real-life settings, such as different contraction levels, static and dynamic motion phases, and effects induced by day-to-day transfers, such as electrode shifts, impedance changes, and psychometric user variability. The improvement in classification accuracy with respect to the unprocessed classifier ranged from 4.8{\%} to 31.6{\%}, depending on the scenarios investigated. The system significantly reduced misclassifications to wrong active classes and is thus a promising approach for improving the robustness of hand prosthesis controllability.},

For this, we first introduce three types of adaptation procedures and investigate them in an offline study with 19 datasets. Then, we select one of the proposed methods and analyze it further. The chosen classifier is offline tested in data from 80 healthy users and four high spinal cord injury patients. Finally, for the first time in BCI literature, we apply this unsupervised classifier in online experiments.

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Processing and pattern recognition of myoelectric signals have been at the core of prosthetic control research in the last decade. Although most studies agree on reporting the accuracy of predicting predefined movements, there is a significant amount of study-dependent variables that make high-resolution inter-study comparison practically impossible. As an effort to provide a common research platform for the development and evaluation of algorithms in prosthetic control, we introduce BioPatRec as open source software. BioPatRec allows a seamless implementation of a variety of algorithms in the fields of (1) Signal processing; (2) Feature selection and extraction; (3) Pattern recognition; and, (4) Real-time control. Furthermore, since the platform is highly modular and customizable, researchers from different fields can seamlessly benchmark their algorithms by applying them in prosthetic control, without necessarily knowing how to obtain and process bioelectric signals, or how to produce and evaluate physically meaningful outputs.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: BioPatRec is demonstrated in this study by the implementation of a relatively new pattern recognition algorithm, namely Regulatory Feedback Networks (RFN). RFN produced comparable results to those of more sophisticated classifiers such as Linear Discriminant Analysis and Multi-Layer Perceptron. BioPatRec is released with these 3 fundamentally different classifiers, as well as all the necessary routines for the myoelectric control of a virtual hand; from data acquisition to real-time evaluations. All the required instructions for use and development are provided in the online project hosting platform, which includes issue tracking and an extensive "wiki". This transparent implementation aims to facilitate collaboration and speed up utilization. Moreover, BioPatRec provides a publicly available repository of myoelectric signals that allow algorithms benchmarking on common data sets. This is particularly useful for researchers lacking of data acquisition hardware, or with limited access to patients.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSIONS: BioPatRec has been made openly and freely available with the hope to accelerate, through the community contributions, the development of better algorithms that can potentially improve the patient's quality of life. It is currently used in 3 different continents and by researchers of different disciplines, thus proving to be a useful tool for development and collaboration.},

abstract = { Abstract— Advanced forearm prosthetic devices employ classifiers to recognize different electromyography (EMG) signal patterns, in order to identify the user's intended motion gesture. The classification accuracy is one of the main determinants of real-time controllability of a prosthetic limb and hence the necessity to achieve as high an accuracy as possible. In this paper, we study the effects of the temporal and spatial information provided to the classifier on its offline performance and analyze their inter-dependencies. EMG data associated with seven practical hand gestures were recorded from partial-hand and trans-radial amputee volunteers as well as able-bodied volunteers. An extensive investigation was conducted to study the effect of analysis window length, window overlap and the number of electrode channels on the classification accuracy as well as their interactions. Our main discoveries are that the effect of analysis window length on classification accuracy is practically independent of the number of electrodes for all participant groups; window overlap has no direct influence on classifier performance, irrespective of the window length, number of channels or limb condition; the type of limb deficiency and the existing channel count influence the reduction in classification error achieved by adding more number of channels; partial-hand amputees outperform trans-radial amputees, with classification accuracies of only 11.3{\%} below values achieved by able-bodied volunteers.},

abstract = {— This paper reports a new myoelectric interface for robotic hand control consisting of two main parts. The first part concerns the motion classification using electromyogram (EMG) signals of a support vector machine (SVM). Because there has been little research on the application of the SVM to motion classification using EMG signals, its effectiveness has not yet been established. The SVM has some advantages with respect to generalization and computational complexity, and therefore, we used the SVM to examine its classification ability. The second part concerns the estimation of an operator's joint angle corresponding to the motion determined by the first part. Estimation of the operator's joint angles is based on EMG-Joint angle models, which express the linear relationships between the EMG signals and joint angles. To verify the effectiveness of our interface, we performed off-line hand motion classification and real-time robotic hand control experiments with eight subjects. The experimental results showed that seven hand motions achieved a classification rate of more than 90{\%} for all subjects. In addition, a three-dimensional computer graphics robotic hand was controlled in real-time (62.5Hz) without delay.},

abstract = {Surface electromyogram (sEMG) signals can be applied in medical, rehabilitation, robotic, and indus- trial fields. As a typical application, amyoelectric prosthetic hand is controlled by the sEMG signals of the amputee's residual muscles. To improve the dexterity of the myoelec- tric prosthetic hand, additional hand motion commands need to be classified. The more sEMG sensors are used, the more hand motion commands can be classified. However, the amputee's residual muscles are limited. In order to improve the practicability of the myoelectric prosthetic hand, it is critical to investigate the effective pattern recog- nition algorithms to deal with the sEMG signals detected by fewer sensors, while identifying asmany handmotion com- mands as possible. Current pattern recognition algorithms for sEMG signals are challenged by limited recognition pat- terns and unsteady classification accuracy rates. To solve these dilemmas, we employed discrete wavelet transform (DWT) and wavelet neural network (WNN) algorithms to improve the pattern recognition effects of sEMG signals. In addition, the back propagation and gradient descent algo- rithmswere utilized to trainWNN. In thiswork, we only used three sEMG sensors to classify and recognize six kinds of hand motion commands. The maximumidentification accu- racy rate is 100{\%}, and an average classification accuracy rate of the proposed WNN is 94.67{\%}, which is substantially better than the artificial neural network (ANN) algorithm.},

abstract = {Users of myoelectric prostheses can often find them difficult to control. This can lead to passive-use of the device or total rejection, which can have detrimental effects on the contralateral limb due to overuse. Current clinically available prostheses are "open loop" systems, and although considerable effort has been focused on developing biofeedback to "close the loop," there is evidence from laboratory-based studies that other factors, notably improving predictability of response, may be as, if not more, important. Interestingly, despite a large volume of research aimed at improving myoelectric prostheses, it is not currently known which aspect of clinically available systems has the greatest impact on overall functionality and everyday usage. A protocol has, therefore, been designed to assess electromyographic (EMG) skill of the user and predictability of the prosthesis response as significant parts of the control chain, and to relate these to functionality and everyday usage. Here, we present the protocol and results from early pilot work. A set of experiments has been developed. First, to characterize user skill in generating the required level of EMG signal, as well as the speed with which users are able to make the decision to activate the appropriate muscles. Second, to measure unpredictability introduced at the skin-electrode interface, in order to understand the effects of the socket-mounted electrode fit under different loads on the variability of time taken for the prosthetic hand to respond. To evaluate prosthesis user functionality, four different outcome measures are assessed. Using a simple upper limb functional task prosthesis users are assessed for (1) success of task completion, (2) task duration, (3) quality of movement, and (4) gaze behavior. To evaluate everyday usage away from the clinic, the symmetricity of their real-world arm use is assessed using activity monitoring. These methods will later be used to assess a prosthesis user cohort to establish the relative contribution of each control factor to the individual measures of functionality and everyday usage (using multiple regression models). The results will support future researchers, designers, and clinicians in concentrating their efforts on the area that will have the greatest impact on improving prosthesis use.},

Cortical reorganization occurs in the brain, but the motor and somatosensorial cortex can interact with the remnant muscles of the missing hand even many years after the amputation, leading to the possibility to restore the capabilities of hand amputees through myoelectric prostheses. Myoelectric hand prostheses with many degrees of freedom are commercially available and recent advances in rehabilitation robotics suggest that their natural control can be performed in real life. The first commercial products exploiting pattern recognition to recognize the movements have recently been released, however the most common control systems are still usually unnatural and must be learned through long training. Dexterous and naturally controlled robotic prostheses can become reality in the everyday life of amputees but the path still requires many steps. This mini-review aims to improve the situation by giving an overview of the advancements in the commercial and scientific domains in order to outline the current and future chances in this field and to foster the integration between market and scientific research.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Active hand prostheses controlled using electromyography (EMG) signals have been used for decades to restore the grasping function, lost after an amputation. Although myocontrol is a simple and intuitive interface, it is also imprecise due to the stochastic nature of the EMG recorded using surface electrodes. Furthermore, the sensory feedback from the prosthesis to the user is still missing. In this study, we present a novel concept to close the loop in myoelectric prostheses. In addition to conveying the grasping force (system output), we provided to the user the online information about the system input (EMG biofeedback).$\backslash$n$\backslash$nMETHODS: As a proof-of-concept, the EMG biofeedback was transmitted in the current study using a visual interface (ideal condition). Ten able-bodied subjects and two amputees controlled a state-of-the-art myoelectric prosthesis in routine grasping and force steering tasks using EMG and force feedback (novel approach) and force feedback only (classic approach). The outcome measures were the variability of the generated forces and absolute deviation from the target levels in routine grasping task, and the root mean square tracking error and the number of sudden drops in force steering task.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: During the routine grasping, the novel method when used by able-bodied subjects decreased twofold the force dispersion as well as absolute deviations from the target force levels, and also resulted in more accurate and stable tracking of the reference force profiles during force steering. Furthermore, the force variability during routine grasping did not increase for the higher target forces with EMG biofeedback. The trend was similar in the two amputees.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSIONS: The study demonstrated that the subjects, including the two experienced users of a myoelectric prosthesis, were able to exploit the online EMG biofeedback to observe and modulate the myoelectric signals, generating thereby more consistent commands. This allowed them to control the force predictively (routine grasping) and with a finer resolution (force steering). The future step will be to implement this promising and simple approach using an electrotactile interface. A prosthesis with a reliable response, following faithfully user intentions, would improve the utility during daily-life use and also facilitate the embodiment of the assistive system.},

To be successful in classification of the EMG signal, selection of a feature vector ought to be carefully considered. However, numerous studies of the EMG signal classification have used a feature set that have contained a number of redundant features. In this study, most complete and up-to-date thirty-seven time domain and frequency domain features have been proposed to be studied their properties. The results, which were verified by scatter plot of features, statistical analysis and classifier, indicated that most time domain features are superfluity and redundancy. They can be grouped according to mathematical property and information into four main types: energy and complexity, frequency, prediction model, and time-dependence. On the other hand, all frequency domain features are calculated based on statistical parameters of EMG power spectral density. Its performance in class separability viewpoint is not suitable for EMG recognition system. Recommendation of features to avoid the usage of redundant features for classifier in EMG signal classification applications is also proposed in this study. ?? 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {Advanced upper limb prostheses capable of actuating multiple degrees of freedom (DOFs) are now commercially available. Pattern recognition algorithms that use surface electromyography (EMG) signals show great promise as multi-DOF controllers. Unfortunately, current pattern recognition systems are limited to activate only one DOF at a time. This study introduces a novel classifier based on Bayesian theory to provide classification of simultaneous movements. This approach and two other classification strategies for simultaneous movements were evaluated using nonamputee and amputee subjects classifying up to three DOFs, where any two DOFs could be classified simultaneously. Similar results were found for nonamputee and amputee subjects. The new approach, based on a set of conditional parallel classifiers was the most promising with errors significantly less (p {\textless} 0.05) than a single linear discriminant analysis (LDA) classifier or a parallel approach. For three-DOF classification, the conditional parallel approach had error rates of 6.6{\%} on discrete and 10.9{\%} on combined motions, while the single LDA had error rates of 9.4{\%} on discrete and 14.1{\%} on combined motions. The low error rates demonstrated suggest than pattern recognition techniques on surface EMG can be extended to identify simultaneous movements, which could provide more life-like motions for amputees compared to exclusively classifying sequential movements.},

Current sEMG pattern-recognition systems suffer from a limited number of patterns that are frequently intensified by the unsuitable accuracy of the instrumentation and analytical system. To solve these problems, we designed a multistep-based sEMG pattern-recognition system where, in each step, a stronger more capable relevant technique with a noticeable improved performance is employed. In this paper, we utilized the sEMG signals to classify and recognize six classes of hand movements. We employed an adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system (ANFIS) to identify hand motion commands. Training the fuzzy system was performed by a hybrid back propagation and least-mean-square algorithm, and for optimizing the number of fuzzy rules, a subtractive-clustering algorithm was utilized. Furthermore, this paper employed time and time-frequency domains and their combination as the features of the sEMG signal. The proposed recognition scheme utilizing the combined features with an ANFIS classification provided the best result in identifying complex hand movements. The maximum identification accuracy rate of 100{\%} and an average classification accuracy of the proposed ANFIS system of 92{\%} proved to be superior in comparison with relevant studies to date.},

abstract = {The use of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) in natural image classification systems has produced very impressive results. Combined with the inherent nature of medical images that make them ideal for deep-learning, further application of such systems to medical image classification holds much promise. However, the usefulness and potential impact of such a system can be completely negated if it does not reach a target accuracy. In this paper, we present a study on determining the optimum size of the training data set necessary to achieve high classification accuracy with low variance in medical image classification systems. The CNN was applied to classify axial Computed Tomography (CT) images into six anatomical classes. We trained the CNN using six different sizes of training data set (5, 10, 20, 50, 100, and 200) and then tested the resulting system with a total of 6000 CT images. All images were acquired from the Massachusetts General Hospital (MGH) Picture Archiving and Communication System (PACS). Using this data, we employ the learning curve approach to predict classification accuracy at a given training sample size. Our research will present a general methodology for determining the training data set size necessary to achieve a certain target classification accuracy that can be easily applied to other problems within such systems.},

abstract = {Despite their massive size, successful deep artificial neural networks can exhibit a remarkably small difference between training and test performance. Conventional wisdom attributes small generalization error either to properties of the model family, or to the regularization techniques used during training. Through extensive systematic experiments, we show how these traditional approaches fail to explain why large neural networks generalize well in practice. Specifically, our experiments establish that state-of-the-art convolutional networks for image classification trained with stochastic gradient methods easily fit a random labeling of the training data. This phenomenon is qualitatively unaffected by explicit regularization, and occurs even if we replace the true images by completely unstructured random noise. We corroborate these experimental findings with a theoretical construction showing that simple depth two neural networks already have perfect finite sample expressivity as soon as the number of parameters exceeds the number of data points as it usually does in practice. We interpret our experimental findings by comparison with traditional models.},

abstract = {User acceptance of myoelectric forearm prostheses is currently low. Awkward control, lack of feedback, and difficult training are cited as primary reasons. Recently, researchers have focused on exploiting the new possibilities offered by advancements in prosthetic technology. Alternatively, researchers could focus on prosthesis acceptance by developing functional requirements based on activities users are likely to perform. In this article, we describe the process of determining such requirements and then the application of these requirements to evaluating the state of the art in myoelectric forearm prosthesis research. As part of a needs assessment, a workshop was organized involving clinicians (representing end users), academics, and engineers. The resulting needs included an increased number of functions, lower reaction and execution times, and intuitiveness of both control and feedback systems. Reviewing the state of the art of research in the main prosthetic subsystems (electromyographic [EMG] sensing, control, and feedback) showed that modern research prototypes only partly fulfill the requirements. We found that focus should be on validating EMG-sensing results with patients, improving simultaneous control of wrist movements and grasps, deriving optimal parameters for force and position feedback, and taking into account the psychophysical aspects of feedback, such as intensity perception and spatial acuity.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Processing and pattern recognition of myoelectric signals have been at the core of prosthetic control research in the last decade. Although most studies agree on reporting the accuracy of predicting predefined movements, there is a significant amount of study-dependent variables that make high-resolution inter-study comparison practically impossible. As an effort to provide a common research platform for the development and evaluation of algorithms in prosthetic control, we introduce BioPatRec as open source software. BioPatRec allows a seamless implementation of a variety of algorithms in the fields of (1) Signal processing; (2) Feature selection and extraction; (3) Pattern recognition; and, (4) Real-time control. Furthermore, since the platform is highly modular and customizable, researchers from different fields can seamlessly benchmark their algorithms by applying them in prosthetic control, without necessarily knowing how to obtain and process bioelectric signals, or how to produce and evaluate physically meaningful outputs.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: BioPatRec is demonstrated in this study by the implementation of a relatively new pattern recognition algorithm, namely Regulatory Feedback Networks (RFN). RFN produced comparable results to those of more sophisticated classifiers such as Linear Discriminant Analysis and Multi-Layer Perceptron. BioPatRec is released with these 3 fundamentally different classifiers, as well as all the necessary routines for the myoelectric control of a virtual hand; from data acquisition to real-time evaluations. All the required instructions for use and development are provided in the online project hosting platform, which includes issue tracking and an extensive "wiki". This transparent implementation aims to facilitate collaboration and speed up utilization. Moreover, BioPatRec provides a publicly available repository of myoelectric signals that allow algorithms benchmarking on common data sets. This is particularly useful for researchers lacking of data acquisition hardware, or with limited access to patients.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSIONS: BioPatRec has been made openly and freely available with the hope to accelerate, through the community contributions, the development of better algorithms that can potentially improve the patient's quality of life. It is currently used in 3 different continents and by researchers of different disciplines, thus proving to be a useful tool for development and collaboration.},

abstract = { Abstract— Advanced forearm prosthetic devices employ classifiers to recognize different electromyography (EMG) signal patterns, in order to identify the user's intended motion gesture. The classification accuracy is one of the main determinants of real-time controllability of a prosthetic limb and hence the necessity to achieve as high an accuracy as possible. In this paper, we study the effects of the temporal and spatial information provided to the classifier on its offline performance and analyze their inter-dependencies. EMG data associated with seven practical hand gestures were recorded from partial-hand and trans-radial amputee volunteers as well as able-bodied volunteers. An extensive investigation was conducted to study the effect of analysis window length, window overlap and the number of electrode channels on the classification accuracy as well as their interactions. Our main discoveries are that the effect of analysis window length on classification accuracy is practically independent of the number of electrodes for all participant groups; window overlap has no direct influence on classifier performance, irrespective of the window length, number of channels or limb condition; the type of limb deficiency and the existing channel count influence the reduction in classification error achieved by adding more number of channels; partial-hand amputees outperform trans-radial amputees, with classification accuracies of only 11.3{\%} below values achieved by able-bodied volunteers.},

abstract = {Unsupervised anomaly detection on multi- or high-dimensional data is of great importance in both fundamental machine learning research and industrial applications, for which density estimation lies at the core. Although previous approaches based on dimensionality reduction followed by density estimation have made fruitful progress, they mainly suffer from decoupled model learning with inconsistent optimization goals and incapability of preserving essential information in the low-dimensional space. In this paper, we present a Deep Autoencoding Gaussian Mixture Model (DAGMM) for unsupervised anomaly detection. Our model utilizes a deep autoencoder to generate a low-dimensional representation and reconstruction error for each input data point, which is further fed into a Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM). Instead of using decoupled two-stage training and the standard Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm, DAGMM jointly optimizes the parameters of the deep autoencoder and the mixture model simultaneously in an end-to-end fashion, leveraging a separate estimation network to facilitate the parameter learning of the mixture model. The joint optimization, which well balances autoencoding reconstruction, density estimation of latent representation, and regularization, helps the autoencoder escape from less attractive local optima and further reduce reconstruction errors, avoiding the need of pre-training. Experimental results on several public benchmark datasets show that, DAGMM significantly outperforms state-of-the-art anomaly detection techniques, and achieves up to 14{\%} improvement based on the standard F1 score.},

With the advent of deep learning, there is an increasing interest in learning deep unsupervised representations for clustering analysis. Many works on this domain rely on variants of auto-encoders and use the encoder outputs as representations/features for clustering. In this paper, we show that an l2 normalization constraint on these representations during auto-encoder training, makes the representations more separable and compact in the Euclidean space after training. This greatly improves the clustering accuracy when k-means clustering is employed on the representations. We also propose a clustering based unsupervised anomaly detection method using l2 normalized deep auto-encoder representations. We show the effect of l2 normalization on anomaly detection accuracy. We further show that the proposed anomaly detection method greatly improves accuracy compared to previously proposed deep methods such as reconstruction error based anomaly detection.},

While many current approaches attempt to define all arm motions using heuristic interpretation, or a combination of several abstract motion primitives, our unsupervised approach generates a hierarchical description of natural human motion with well recognized groups. Reliable recommendation of a subset of motions for task achievement is beneficial to various fields, such as robotic and semi-autonomous prosthetic device applications. The proposed method makes use of well-known techniques such as dynamic time warping (DTW) to obtain a divergence measure between motion segments, DTW barycenter averaging (DBA) the hierarchical tree. The clusters that emerge summarize the variety of recorded motions into the following general tasks: reach-to-front, transfer-box, drinking from vessel, on-table motion, turning a key or door knob, and reach-to-back pocket. The clustering methodology is justified by comparing against an alternative measure of divergence using Bezier coefficients and K-medoids clustering.},
